A simple powershell script that changes a few settings in your device to stop Global Tales Runner from crashing randomly.

**IMPORTANT:** In the **Releases** page, there will be an executable to make your life easier. Put the executable or the ps1 file in the **same folder** as **trgame.exe**.
This repository is just to let you know there's nothing sketchy in the script.

Any questions, contact me through discord: **afallen**
